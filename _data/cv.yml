      year: 2021 - NOW
      description: Strain Gauge implemented using the wires of a PCB. The intention was to use it as a bed levelling sensor in 3D printers. All the demo boards I had laying around was aquired by a professor at OHSU.

      year: 2020 - NOW
      description: Battery Spot welder with power estimation using internal RDS on of the driver mosfets. I never got to test it because of the component shortage. 
    - title: <a href="https://github.com/magborresen/3d_power_meter">3D Power Meter</a>
      year: 2022 - NOW
      description: Power Meter developed for use in 3D printers. ADC Data can be read using a Raspberry Pi on the 3D printer using an SPI protocol. The Pi can then show the calculate and show power values based on the current received from the board. Uses a Hall-effect sensor for current measurement.
